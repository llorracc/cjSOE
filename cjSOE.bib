  abstract =      {This paper examines the hypothesis that the
                   persistence of low spatial and marital mobility in
                   rural India, despite increased growth rates and
                   rising inequality in recent years, is due to the
                   existence of sub-caste networks that provide mutual
                   insurance to their members. Unique panel data
                   providing information on income, assets, gifts,
                   loans, consumption, marriage, and migration are used
                   to link caste networks to household and aggregate
                   mobility. Our key finding, consistent with the
                   hypothesis that local risk-sharing networks restrict
                   mobility, is that among households with the same
                   (permanent) income, those in higher-income caste
                   networks are more likely to participate in
                   caste-based insurance arrangements and are less
                   likely to both out-marry and out-migrate. At the
                   aggregate level, the networks appear to have coped
                   successfully with the rising inequality within
                   sub-castes that accompanied the Green Revolution. The
                   results suggest that caste networks will continue to
                   smooth consumption in rural India for the foreseeable
                   future, as they have for centuries, unless
                   alternative consumption-smoothing mechanisms of
                   comparable quality become available.},
